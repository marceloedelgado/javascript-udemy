"use strict"

// "use Strict" is a good practice over variable declaration
// if you use a variable without declaring it before, Javascript works anyway
// but with strict mode, any variable not declared before doesn't work



let x = 10; 
console.log(x);

miFuncion();

function miFuncion() {
    let y = 15;
    console.log(y);
}
